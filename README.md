# Accordion Project 

## What I learnt
I learnt a lot about react states and conditional rendering. This is a perfect beginners project to practice both topics

## Implementation 
First, I built an accordion with that opens an element if it is selected.
    -[] open an element when it is clicked 
    -[] close an element when it clicked while open 
    -[] close an open element when another element is clicked 

Multi-Selection 
    -[] open an element when it is clicked 
    -[] close an element when it clicked while open 
    -[] keep all open element open when another element is clicked
